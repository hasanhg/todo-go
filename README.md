## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To Do Go requires 
* a database to keep track of tasks pushed to the list, only Redis is supported currently,

* a Kubernetes cluster to deploy both <a href="https://github.com/hasanhg/todo-go/tree/master/todo-api">todo-api</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hasanhg/todo-go/tree/master/todo-client">todo-client</a>,

* a GitHub account to run the workflow created for building/testing and deploying the project on every commit in an automated way.

### Installation

You can install your own production environment by applying the YAML files to your Kubernetes cluster at <a href="https://github.com/hasanhg/todo-go/tree/master/todo-api/k8s">todo-api/k8s</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hasanhg/todo-go/tree/master/todo-client/k8s">todo-client/k8s</a> folders.

> **[!]** Do not forget to deploy nginx ingress controller on your cluster and to make necessary changes in deployment and ingress YAML files.
